## Pytorch
The model is built using `PyTorch` as an aspect, PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library (Yasar, 2022).

- To use PyTorch to make an LSTM model the following steps are taken:
    - `import torch`
    - `import torch.nn`
    

It is particulary relevant to our chosen `LSTM` model because
