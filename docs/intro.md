In this project, we present a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify news articles as real or fake based on their textual content. LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are particularly effective for sequential data tasks due to their ability to capture long range dependencies and contextual information within text. This makes them well-suited for natural language processing tasks such as fake news detection, where meaning often depends on the broader context of sentences and paragraphs.

Our dataset is made up of news articles published between March 31, 2015, and February 19, 2018, with a primary focus on American political content. The volume of articles increases around February 2016, coinciding with the onset of the U.S. presidential primaries, which means there was a likely increase in politically charged information, both real and fabricated.

This report outlines the architecture and implementation of the LSTM model, details the data preprocessing steps, and discusses the strategies used for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. Through this approach, we aim to develop a reliable and scalable method for classifying fake news articles using deep learning techniques.
