# The Dataset

### Fake News detection dataset
The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/data .

There are two datasets included, we have `Fake.csv` and `True.csv` where the structure is as follows â†’

## Structure:
- Dataset separated in two files:

    - Fake.csv (23502 fake news article)
    - True.csv (21417 true news article)

- Dataset columns (features):

    - Title: title of news article
    - Text: body text of news article
    - Subject: subject of news article
    - Date: publish date of news article

The targets for the data are `Fake` and `True`, thus the classification of the dataset is a binary classification.

## Data management:

To be able to work with the data appropriately, a file `Create_Dataset.py` merges the true and fake datasets and returns the dataset as a merged and shuffled collection.

Additionally, the features in the dataset were seperated into dependant and independant features so that it can be determined which features rely on others to be classified in the model.
